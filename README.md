# OperaExtOptions

OperaExtOptions is a JavaScript library (written in TypeScript) for automating the options pages of Opera extensions for Opera 15 and newer. It provides you two things: a `SettingStorage` class which simplifies saving and retrieving settings, and a script which binds controls on an extension's options page to values in storage.

Also included is a default stylesheet and demonstration options page which mimic the style of Opera's internal pages. Since extensions cannot access Opera's resources, I have included a number of background images of varying sizes and styles. If you base your options page from the demonstration page, I suggest you choose a background style or add your own, then remove all of the other background images to reduce the size of your extension.
